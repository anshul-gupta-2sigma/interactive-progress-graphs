Write a function ``print_triangular_numbers(n)`` that prints out the first
n triangular numbers. A call to ``print_triangular_numbers(5)`` would
produce the following output::

    1       1
    2       3
    3       6
    4       10
    5       15

(*hint: use a web search to find out what a triangular number is.*)
